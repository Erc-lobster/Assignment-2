            I'm about to rise, I'm about to shine
            I'm about to, I'm about to leave this all behind
            I'm about to check, I'm about to change
            I'm about to realign, connect, and rearrange
            Howling at the moon
            Kryptonite the sun
            But living in a daze for weeks, and months, and years, I'm done
            The ace is in the base
            The sign it says to stop
            Well I'm about to, I'm about to, I'm about to drop
            And my heart sings       
        </p>

        <p class="chorus">
            I watch the clock tick-tock
            Been saving all the green that I got
            I can't wait to kick off my work shoes
            I watch the clock tick-tock
            Been saving all the green that I got
            I can't wait to kick off my work shoes
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-segment2">
            I'm about to seek, I'm about to find
            I'm about to calibrate and shift my state of mind
            I'm about to flux, I'm about to flow
            I'm about to, I'm about to, I'm about to blow
            Time to start again
            It's time to move my feet
            Life is but a fortune cookie puzzle to complete
            A record's built to spin
            The bubble wants to pop
            So I'm about to, I'm about to, I'm about to drop
            And my heart sings
        </p>

        <p class="chorus">
            I watch the clock tick-tock
            Been saving all the green that I got
            I can't wait to kick off my work shoes
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-segment3">
            And once I hit the spot
            That's the greatest fucking feeling I got
            I can't wait to kick off my work shoes
            Well I'm not leaving till the whistle blows
            I'm not leaving till the whistle blows, blows, blows, blows
        </p>

            And Once I hit the spot
